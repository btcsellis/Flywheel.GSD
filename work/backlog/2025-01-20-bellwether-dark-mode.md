## Description

Users have requested dark mode. Implement system-preference detection with manual override. Store preference in localStorage.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dark mode styles for all components
- [ ] Respects system preference by default
- [ ] Toggle in settings to override
- [ ] Preference persists across sessions
- [ ] No flash of wrong theme on load

## Notes

Already using Tailwind, so dark: variants should make this straightforward.
