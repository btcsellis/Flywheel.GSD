## Description

The board currently shows a count of 5 transitioning items at the top, but only one is actually transitioning. I suspect there are leftover artifacts that need to be cleaned up. More importantly, we should check to make sure all transitioning markers make sense, i.e. that the work item is in a state that is consistent with the marker.
