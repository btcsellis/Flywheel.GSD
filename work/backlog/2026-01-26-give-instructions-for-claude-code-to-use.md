## Description

I have had issues becuase CC tries to set the worktree or tmux session or acceptance criteria or other things when creating a new work item based on an ad hoc prompt. Let's find a good way to make sure they're created without those things that get assigned when the item is defined. A new work item should really just have a title, description, area, project, and optionally due date and important flag. Nothing else.
